To generate your own README, git clone the repo.

Run ```npm install``` in order to install npm package dependencies.

The application will start by running ```node index.js``` in the command line.

Answer the prompts in your command line to generate the README.

After answering all the prompts, your README file will be named 'your-README.md' and will be ready for you at the root of the repo.
